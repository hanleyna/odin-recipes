    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons clarified butter (ghee), or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tikka Masala Sauce Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely grated ginger, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (13 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/2  cup chicken broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken in a bowl. Drizzle vegetable oil over chicken; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Whisk together salt, garam masala, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cardamom in a small bowl. Sprinkle over chicken and turn to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Melt clarified butter in a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Cook chicken thighs in hot butter until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate. When cool enough to handle, cut chicken into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Place the skillet with chicken drippings over medium-high heat. Stir onion into the skillet; saut√© until onion softens and turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook until paste caramelizes, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic and ginger into tomato-onion mixture; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour crushed tomatoes into the skillet. Bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Pour in coconut milk and chicken broth; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors blend and sauce is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken and any accumulated juices into sauce. Add cilantro and red pepper flakes; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until chicken is cooked through and tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
